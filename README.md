# AUT Data & Information Analysis Project

This repository contains the files of my project for the Data & Information
Analysis course at AUT (Tehran Polytechnic).

## Part 1

In this section, min-max features scaling and feature standardization were
implemented.

## Part 2

In this section, an outlier detector was implemented that used z-score to find
the outliers.

## Part 3

In this section, the k-means algorithm was implemented using functional
programming patterns. The function returns the within-cluster sum of squares and
the labels of the clustered data.
