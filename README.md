# AUT Data & Information Analysis Project

This repository contains my project for the Data & Information Analysis course
at AUT (Tehran Polytechnic).

## Part 1

In this section, "min-max feature scaling" and "feature standardization" were
implemented.

## Part 2

In this section, an outlier detector was implemented that used the z-score
method to find outliers.

## Part 3

In this section, the k-means clustering algorithm was implemented using
functional programming patterns. The function returns the within-cluster sum of
squares and the labels of the clustered data.
